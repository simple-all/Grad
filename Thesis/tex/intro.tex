\section{Introduction}

In a System of Systems (SoS), an architecture defines how systems interact through non-physical communication \cite{Maier1996}, which impacts SoS performance. The ability to adapt between various architectures might allow for an SoS to optimize its performance for a given situation. In the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), system interaction is handle by Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC) \cite{MDA_C2BMC}. Under Maier's architecting principles, C2BMC would classify the BMDS as a directed architecture, in which individual systems are able to operate independently, but are centrally controlled by a master decision maker \cite{Maier1996}. However, if the BMDS were to experience network outages or be the target of cyber warfare, a decentralized acknowledged architecture may prove advantageous in reaction to the new operating environment. This research aims to identify possible scenarios in which an alternate architecture would benefit BMDS performance and propose a method to optimize the BMDS architecture as a situation develops.
